// Question 1: The Guest List Formatter
// Goal: Practice Template Literals and Array Methods.
// Write a function called formatGuests that takes an array of names. The function should:
// Remove the first name from the list (it’s the host, not a guest).
// Add "Guest: " before each remaining name using .map().
// Return a single string where each guest is on a new line.
function formatGuests(names) {
    names.shift();
    let guest = names.map(name => `Guest: ${name}`);
    return guest.join("\n");
}
let list = ["Simmi", "Summi", "Kriti" ,"Roy"];
console.log(formatGuests(list));



// Question 2: The Logic Gate (Filter & Math)
// Goal: Practice Arrow Functions, filter, and Math methods.
// Create an arrow function called getHighNumbers. It should take an array of mixed types (strings and numbers) and:
// Filter the array to keep only the numbers.
// Filter those numbers again to only keep ones greater than a random threshold between 1 and 50.
// Return the final array.
let getHighNumbers = (arr) => {
    let threshold = Math.floor(Math.random() * 50) + 1;
    return arr
        .filter(x => typeof x === "number")
        .filter(num => num > threshold);     
};
let a = [10, "hi", 45, 60, "Simmi", 25];
console.log(getHighNumbers(a));

// Question 3: The Price Calculator
// Goal: Practice Type Conversion and splice.
// You have an array of prices, but they are currently strings. Write a script that:
// Removes the last item in the array using an array method (because it's a "handling fee" you want to calculate separately).
// Converts the remaining string prices into actual numbers.
// Calculates the sum of those numbers using an arrow function.
// Prints: "Total Price: $[sum]" using a template literal.
let price = ["100", "200", "300", "50","900"];
price.pop();
let total = price
    .map(p => Number(p))
    .reduce((sum, val) => sum + val, 0);
console.log(`Total Price: $${total}`);
